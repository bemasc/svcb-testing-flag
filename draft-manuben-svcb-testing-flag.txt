         The "testing" flag for Service Binding (SVCB) Records
                 draft-manuben-svcb-testing-flag-latest

Abstract

   This draft defines a flag to mark a service endpoint as being
   potentially unreliable.  This flag may be useful when introducing new
   features that could have a negative impact on availability.

1.  Introduction

   The Service Binding (SVCB) DNS record type [RFC9460], and SVCB-
   compatible types like HTTPS, convey a collection of endpoints that
   can provide a service, along with metadata about each of those
   endpoints.  This metadata can include enumerating protocol features
   that are available and supported on those endpoints.

   In most cases, advertising new features is unlikely to render the
   service unavailable, because clients will fall back to other SVCB
   records or other connection modes.  However, for security-enhancing
   features, this fallback behavior would create a loss of security
   against an active attacker, so it is generally not allowed.  Instead,
   if the feature does not work as expected, the client will "fail
   closed".  This behavior can make it challenging to deploy these
   features, as the initial public deployment can create an outage if
   the service is misconfigured.

   This document defines a new SVCB SvcParam to help service operators
   offer new security features.  By marking these features as still
   being tested, the operator advises the client to interpret problems
   as an accidental failure by the operator, not a malicious action by
   an active attacker.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Specification

   The "testing" flag is a SvcParamKey that always has an empty value in
   presentation and wire format.  When present, this flag indicates that
   this ServiceMode record is subject to outages, and clients SHOULD NOT
   interpret connection failures as evidence of an active attack.

   Service owners SHOULD ensure that this flag is mandatory, either
   explicitly (by adding mandatory=testing to the SvcParams) or
   implicitly if this parameter is "automatically mandatory" for the
   protocol mapping.  Future protocol mappings SHOULD make this SvcParam
   "automatically mandatory".

3.1.  Interaction with SvcPriority

   Clients SHOULD NOT alter the priority of SVCB records based on the
   presence of the "testing" flag.  Deprioritizing SVCB records with
   this flag would result in little or no user traffic making use of the
   testing record, which would defeat the goal of validating that new
   features function correctly for real users.

3.2.  Example: Encrypted DNS Protocol

   Consider the case of a plaintext DNS server operator at
   "dns.example.com" who would like to announce support for DNS over TLS
   [RFC7858].  Per [RFC9461], this operator could publish a record like:

   _dns.dns.example.com. SVCB 1 . alpn=dot

   Clients following [RFC9461] would retrieve this record, observe that
   DNS over TLS is available, and attempt to use it on TCP port 853.  If
   the TLS session cannot be established for any reason, a compliant
   client will not fall back to plaintext DNS on UDP port 53, because
   the failure could indicate an active attack ([RFC9461], Section 8.2).
   If the operator of "dns.example.com" does not have operational
   confidence in their DNS over TLS service, this failure mode could
   raise concerns about the potential consequences of offering this new
   service.

   To reduce the risk associated with this new service, the operator
   could instead use the new "testing" flag as follows:

   _dns.dns.example.com. SVCB 1 . alpn=dot testing mandatory=testing

   Clients that do not implement this specification will ignore the
   record because it specifies an unrecognized mandatory SvcParam.  They
   will continue to use plaintext DNS.  Clients that respect the
   "testing" flag will attempt to use DNS over TLS, but they will fall
   back to plaintext DNS if DNS over TLS is non-functional.

4.  Security Considerations

   Use of the "testing" flag explicitly disables SVCB's defense against
   active attackers.  This is a loss in security.  However, the intent
   of this flag is to facilitate the deployment of security-enhancing
   protocols.  Downgrade-resistant security is achieved only when the
   testing period is complete and the "testing" flag is removed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add this entry to the SVCB SvcParams Registry:

   +========+=========+================+===================+===========+
   | Number | Name    | Meaning        | Change            | Reference |
   |        |         |                | Controller        |           |
   +========+=========+================+===================+===========+
   | TBD    | testing | Record may not | IETF              | (This     |
   |        |         | be reliable    |                   | document) |
   +--------+---------+----------------+-------------------+-----------+
